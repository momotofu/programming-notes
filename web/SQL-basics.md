### SQL Data Types
Here's just a sampling of the many data types that SQL supports. We won't be using most of these types in this course, though. The exact list of types differs from one database to another. For a full list of types, check the manual for your database, such as this one for PostgreSQL.

Text and string types
text — a string of any length, like Python str or unicode types.
char(n) — a string of exactly n characters.
varchar(n) — a string of up to n characters.

### Numeric types
integer — an integer value, like Python int.
real — a floating-point value, like Python float. Accurate up to six decimal places.
double precision — a higher-precision floating-point value. Accurate up to 15 decimal places.
decimal — an exact decimal value.

### Date and time types
date — a calendar date; including year, month, and day.
time — a time of day.
timestamp — a date and time together.
timestamp with time zone — a timestamp that carries time zone information.

The type timestamp with time zone can be abbreviated to timestamptz in PostgreSQL.

### Select statement
The most basic form of the select statement is to select a single scalar value:

```select 2 + 2;```
More usefully, we can select one or more columns from a table. With no restrictions, this will return all rows in the table:

```select name, species from animals;```
Columns are separated by commas; use * to select all columns from the tables:

```select * from animals;```
Quite often, we don't want all the data from a table. We can restrict the rows using a variety of select clauses, listed below. There are also a wide variety of functions that can apply to columns; including aggregation functions that operate on values from several rows, such as max and count.

### where
The where clause expresses restrictions — filtering a table for rows that follow a particular rule. where supports equalities, inequalities, and boolean operators (among other things):

```where species = 'gorilla'``` — return only rows that have 'gorilla' as the value of the species column.
```where name >= 'George'``` — return only rows where the name column is alphabetically after 'George'.
```where species != 'gorilla'``` and name != 'George' — return only rows where species isn't 'gorilla' and name isn't 'George'.

### limit / offset
The limit clause sets a limit on how many rows to return in the result table. The optional offset clause says how far to skip ahead into the results. So limit 10 offset 100 will return 10 results starting with the 101st.

### order by
The order by clause tells the database how to sort the results — usually according to one or more columns. So order by species, name says to sort results first by the species column, then by name within each species.

Ordering happens before limit/offset, so you can use them together to extract pages of alphabetized results. (Think of the pages of a dictionary.)

The optional desc modifier tells the database to order results in descending order — for instance from large numbers to small ones, or from Z to A.

### group by
The group by clause is only used with aggregations, such as max or sum. Without a group by clause, a select statement with an aggregation will aggregate over the whole selected table(s), returning only one row. With a group by clause, it will return one row for each distinct value of the column or expression in the group by clause.

### having
The having clause works like the where clause, but it applies after group by aggregations take place. Here's an example:
```
select col1, sum(col2) as total
    from table
    group by col1
    having total > 500 ;
```
Usually, at least one of the columns will be an aggregate function such as count, max, or sum on one of the tables' columns. In order to apply having to an aggregated column, you'll want to give it a name using as.

For instance, if you had a table of items sold in a store, and you wanted to find all the items that have sold more than five units, you could use:

```
select name, count(*) as num from sales having num > 5;
```
You can have a select statement that uses only where, or only group by, or group by and having, or where and group by, or all three of them! But it doesn't usually make sense to use having without group by.

If you use both where and having, the where condition will filter the rows that are going into the aggregation, and the having condition will filter the rows that come out of it.

## All the tables in the zoo database
A database of zoo animals is used as an example in many of the code exercises in this course. Here's a list of all the tables available in it, and what the columns in each table refer to —

#### animals
This table lists individual animals in the zoo. Each animal has only one row. There may be multiple animals with the same name, or even multiple animals with the same name and species.

name — the animal's name (example: 'George')
species — the animal's species (example: 'gorilla')
birthdate — the animal's date of birth (example: '1998-05-18')

#### diet
This table matches up species with the foods they eat. Every species in the zoo eats at least one sort of food, and many eat more than one.

species — the name of a species (example: 'hyena')
food — the name of a food that species eats (example: 'meat')

The diet table shows an example of the important database concept of normalization. If a species eats more than one food, there will be more than one row for that species. We do this instead of having multiple food columns (or storing a list in a single column), both of which would make select statements impractical.

#### taxonomy
This table gives the (partial) biological taxonomic names for each species in the zoo. It can be used to find which species are more closely related to each other evolutionarily.

name — the common name of the species (e.g. 'jackal')
species — the taxonomic species name (e.g. 'aureus')
genus — the taxonomic genus name (e.g. 'Canis')
family — the taxonomic family name (e.g. 'Canidae')
t_order — the taxonomic order name (e.g. 'Carnivora')

If you've never heard of this classification, don't worry about it; the details won't be necessary for this course. But if you're curious, the Wikipedia article Taxonomy (biology)) may help.

The t_order column is not called order because "order" is a reserved keyword in SQL.

#### ordernames
This table gives the common names for each of the taxonomic orders in the taxonomy table.

t_order — the taxonomic order name (e.g. 'Cetacea')
name — the common name (e.g. 'whales and dolphins')

## Insert statement
The basic syntax for the insert statement:

```insert into tablename ( col1, col2, ... ) values ( val1, val2, ... );```
If the values are in the same order as the table's columns (starting with the first column), you don't have to specify the columns in the insert statement:

```insert into tablename values ( val1, val2, ... );```
For instance, if a table has three columns (a, b, c) and you want to insert into a and b, you can leave off the column names from the insert statement. But if you want to insert into b and c, or a and c, you have to specify the columns.

Normally, a single insert statement can only insert into a single table. (Contrast this with the select statement, which can pull data from several tables using a join.)
